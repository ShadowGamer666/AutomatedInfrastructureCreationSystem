# Automated Infrastructure Creation System 
The portfolio of all script and code that I have implemented within my Automated Infrastructure Creation System as part of my FYP.
(Consists of both Client and Server Scripts and so will not execute as formatted in this showcase Git Repo. See Presentation Demo video to observe system in operation.)
